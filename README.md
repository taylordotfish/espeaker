espeaker
========

Version 0.1.1

**espeaker** is an IRC bot which allows users to listen to IRC with the
text-to-speech program [espeak]. It converts IRC messages into SSML data that
can be piped to and read by espeak. Users can be given unique voices.

[espeak]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESpeak

espeaker runs over a network socket, allowing people to connect to it and pipe
the data to espeak. Use the command `nc <espeaker-host> <espeaker-port> |
espeak -m` to connect and listen to espeaker. Option `-m` enables SSML support
in espeak.

Edit `conf.py` to give users espeak voices. See `espeak --voices` and
`espeak --voices=variant` to see what voices and variants you can use.

Usage
-----

`espeaker <port> <irc-host> <irc-port> <nickname> <channel>`

`<port>` is the port the espeaker server should run on, not the port of the IRC
server (which is `<irc-port>`).

espeaker will ask for a NickServ password when started. Supply an empty
password if you don't want to use one.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3.3 or higher
